# Search Engine (Forms Project)
## Project 6: Search Engine using HTML Forms and CSS (The Odin Project)

## Description: 
Welcome to my sixth web development project! This is part of my coursework in The Odin Project, a free, open-source curriculum to learn fullstack web development! 

This project was built in HTML, CSS, and just a little bit of JavaScript! 

The task for this project was to build a sign up form. I decided to expand this just for fun! I hope you enjoy!
